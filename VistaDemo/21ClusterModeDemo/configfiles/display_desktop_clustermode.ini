# in cluster mode, there are different synchronization methods available,

# left for compatibility.

# The DATASYNCTYPE specifies the method to distribute data from the master
# to the slaves. It will be used for distribution of events by the ClusterMode,
# and the ClusterDataSync object. Available options are:
#   DUMMY           a dummy datasync does not actually sync (used for standalone mode)
#   TCP             data is distributed over TCP/IP connections to each slaves.
#                   since a separate connection is used for each slave, this may lead
#                   to high bandwidth usage when many slaves are present
#   ZEROMQ          Only available if the VistaKernel has been build with ZeroMQ+PGM support
#                   Uses the PGM reliable multicast protocol over ZeroMQ to distribute data,
#                   which requires no additional bandwidth for many slaves.
#   INTERPROC       distributes data over interprocess shared memory, and thus only
#                   works when all nodes run on the same machine
# We'll use TCP here, since we only have two slaves and don't know if VistaKernel
# was built with ZeroMQ/PGM support. We could use InterProc, but TCP is more commonly used.
DATASYNCTYPE        = TCP
# The BARRIERTYPE specifies the method used for barriers, a method to wait until all nodes
# reach a certain computation state, and then sends out a GO signal to all nodes at once.
# Available options are:
#   DUMMY           a dummy barrier that does not actually wait (used for clustermode)
#   TCP             All slaves report their ready-state over a TCP/IP connection, and
#                   the GO signal is also sent over TCP/IP connections from master to slave.
#                   Notice that due to the sequential sending of GO using multiple connections,
#                   the GO signal may arrive at slaves at non-negligibly different times.
#   BROADCAST       All slaves report their ready-state over a TCP/IP connection, and
#                   the GO signal is sent using a broadcast UDP/IP packet.
#                   Especially for many slavs, the GO signal should have signigicantly less
#                   variation of arrival time on the slaves than for TCP
#   INTERPROC       Uses interproc mutexes (mutices?), so it will only work on one machine
# usually we would use broadcast - however, on localhost broadcasting doesn't always work
# properly, so lets stick to TCP
BARRIERTYPE         = TCP
# The SWAPSYNCTYPE specifies the mode to be used for swap syncing, which is performed
# after rendering, before buffers are swapped to display the rendered images.
# This helps to reduce tearing, where different parts of the image show the application
# state at different timestamps, especially when combined with genlocking.
# There are different options
#   DUMMY | TCP | BROADCAST | INTERPROC are the same as for BARRIERTYPE
#   DEFAULT         Uses the same mode as BARRIERTYPE
#   GSYNC           Uses nVidia-specific OpenGL extensions for framelocking. This mode only
#                   works with nVidia graphics cards that are synchronized in a GSync ring
SWAPSYNCTYPE        = TCP

# depending on the DataSync/Barrier/SwapSync, different settings are required 
# TCP/IP connection related settings are not specified in the master config settings, but
# for each slave
