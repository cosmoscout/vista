VistaDemo uses CMake (www.cmake.org/) with version 2.8.5 or greater.
Furthermore, it requires custom cmake extensions called VistaCMakeCommon, which can be checked out from the svn or downloaded from sourceforge.
To ensure cmake finds the VistaCMakeCommon, either define the VISTA_CMAKE_COMMON environment variable.
On more information about external dependencies, blease refer to the BUILDINFO file of VistaCoreLibs.

Configure VistaDemo with cmake, either from the VistaDemo folder, or from the toplevel ViSTA forlder to build it together with the VistaCoreLibs.
Afterwards, build it, and run the desired demo app.
