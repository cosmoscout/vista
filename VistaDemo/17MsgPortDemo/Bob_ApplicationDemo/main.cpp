What is Bob doing?

In short: Bob receives an event from Alice and reacts accordingly.

A bit more in depth:
We have a bit more complex structure here than with Alice.

We have the CommandHandler that awaits a VistaEvent telling him that a message/event from Alice
came in. Depending on the message the CommandHandler tells Bob what to do.

I for my part find that Bob looks like a blockhead this way. For the matter of abstraction I
accept this. However one could think about Merging CommandHandler and Bob, making Bob
follow Alice directly. But maybe Alice and Bob only had a hissy fight ...
