       the writer is constantly, but maybe at a lower frequency, updating
       the internal parameters of the force calculation algorithm.
       The interface for this is to be defined by subclasses.
       Once all parameters are set, the user code is to call Publish()
       which will transfer the new parameter set to the ''reader'', i.e.,
       the force feedback device.
   * - the ''reader'' which is in this case the force feedback device.
       the device will call the UpdateForce() method frequently in order
       to retrieve new forces and torque values. Zero values are allowed
       here to indicate that no force/torque is to be rendered by the device.
   * Subclasses of the IForceAlgorithm thus have to define two things:
   * - the interface to define the force algorithm parameters
   * - the calculation of the force effect based on these parameters inside
       of the UpdateForce() method. This ensures that the force calculation
       is performed with the frequency of the force feedback device.
