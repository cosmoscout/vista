/**
 * Some drivers use connections for their communication with the device.
 * If so, they can export a connection aspect that defines the number of
 * connections needed, and the role of each connection for the driver.
 * Valid roles are driver specific, but can be queried through the aspect
 * interface.
 * Connections are organized by assigning a driver role to an index. The
 * driver role is a human readable string that can be assigned dynamically and
 * is driver specific. Connections have attach and detach sequences which
 * are calls right after initialization and when the connection is about to
 * be closed respectively. They may be set on a per-connection level. This
 * may be useful, i.e., when some driver needs a token sent after the connection
 * is opened (e.g. an initialization command) or something similar in order
 * to really shut down (e.g. an explicit quit command).
 * The connection aspect also defines some macro like methods that may be used
 * to simplify the implementation of a driver (such as SendCommand() or
 * GetCommand().
