/**
 * An in-place filter is a special kind of filter that does only local modifications
 * to incoming packets before giving them to the oubound component. Modifications can
 * include things as modifying time-stamps, simply counting or profiling, or things
 * like content-tranformation (e.g. changing coordinates for device-packets and the like).
 * Subtypes should only need to define FilterPacketL() and return a non-NULL packet
 * to be delivered. Note that in-place filtering means, that<br>
 * <h3>p1 = (*this).FilterPacketL(p2) =&gt; (p1 == p2) == true</h3><br>
 * ('==' compares pointers, not content!)
