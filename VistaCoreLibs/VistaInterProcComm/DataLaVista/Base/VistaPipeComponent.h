 * This is the base class for all pipe-components.
 * It does define the interface for attaching and detaching of in- and output to other
 * pipe-components. This is true for most elements, except maybe teeing or aggregating filters and
 * can be overridden at the cost of two pointers ;). Furthermore we can see here that any component
 * has an input and an output type-id for packets; this id will be the same for all elements except
 * transforming filters, most probably. Any component can be the end and the beginning pipe-element.
 * In order to check pipe-constraints this has to be unambigiously defined (see
 * IsDataProducer/IsDataConsumer). Components can be either active or passive. In case the component
 * is active, there will be something like an update-thread that takes care of the function of the
 * component. A non-active component is passive.
