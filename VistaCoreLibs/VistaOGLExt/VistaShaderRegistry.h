/**
 * The VistaShaderRegistry is a central class for loading and retrieving shader
 * sources from separate shader files (e.g. *.glsl). Renderers that require a
 * shader should directly retrieve its source via this class. To retrieve shader
 * sources the renderer needs to specify the respective shader's filename.
 * The registry will then attempt to locate the shader file in a list of search
 * directories. If the shader is found its source will be loaded and cached for
 * future access. There is no need for the user of renderers that access the
 * VistaShaderRegistry to manually load the shaders. Only the search paths need
 * to be set correctly. Besides automated loading via search paths, the user
 * has always the possibility to pre-cache shaders manually.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: Filenames of shader files _MUST_ be unique. If two different
 * renderers want to access two different shaders that have the same filename,
 * problems will eventually occur.
