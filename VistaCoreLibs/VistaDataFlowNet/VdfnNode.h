      a call to this method, nothing is certain ;) and every variable has to

 * -# GetIsValid() usually sees whether all inports were connected. Overriding
      this can be useful in case the node offers optional nodes or outer
      constraints have to be obeyed. A node that is not valid is not evaluated,
      so the test should be rather quick, as the graph will poke on this frequently.
 * -# DoEvalNode() the actual computation, defining this is a must for new nodes.
 *
 * Nodes do not have default ports. Deleting a node will delete all resources
 * dealing with ports, including port-type compares.
