/**
 * This is an in-evaluation logging node that accepts only TVdfnPort<std::string>
 * type ports as an input source. It will write to a standard ofstream on any
 * evaluation that happens when the input has changed. It can be used to
 * create a table like output that can be read with a CSV reader or tools
 * like gnuplot. Note that it might be possible that the conversion from the inport
 * types has to take place outside but within the network itself, so this is a
 * time-consuming process as an addition to the writing of the data to the file.
 * On buffered file systems, the file writing might not be that expensive, while
 * the format conversion can be.
 *
 * @ingroup VdfnNodes
 * @inport{some\,depending on the inports set,string,optional,attach an inport of
           type string to write to the output log file when the port changes}

class VISTADFNAPI VdfnLoggerNode : public VdfnShallowNode {
 public:
  /**
   * Constructor, initializes the file handle that is used
   * throughout the processing by opening a file with the
   * name strLogFile.
   * @param strLogFileName the log file to open, give an absolute
            or relative path
* @param bWriteHeader determines, whether a header line in written
            during PrepareEvaluationRun(). The header line consists
                    of the in-port names as given using SetInPort()
* @param bWriteTimeStamp determines whether a timestamp is prepended
            to each record written to the log file. The timestamp is
                    the value returned be GetUpdateTimeStamp() which is set by
                    IVdfnNode::DoEvaluate()
* @param bWriteTimeDiff determines whether a time difference between the
            current time stamp and the last record write time stamp is prepended
                    to each record as a second attribute. Can be sometimes handy, when relative
                    times are needed (e.g., for gnuplot or timing measures).
                    Note that you can not write time diffs without writing the absolute timestamps,
                    which means that if bWriteTimeStamp is set to false no time diff will
                    be written.
* @param liPorts the port-sort order to write the attributes in each record.
            When empty, the attributes are sorted as determined by GetInPortNames() and
                    written to the log file, otherwise they are written in the order as given
                    by this list. If a port-name is in this list, but not connected, it will
                    appear in the log-file and its value will be constant "<not-set>" (or similar),
                    in order to keep the index and the order of each attribute as determined by the
user
* @param liTrigger determines which ports are relevant in order to trigger a record-write to
            the log-file. If empty, a record will be written on any change of any input port,
                    otherwise, any input port given by name in the trigger list will be inspected.
                    The strategy is to keep a list of revision stamps that will be used for
comparison, and a record will be written on the first non-match of the stored revision and the input
port revision. This can be useful, if you want to record only on changes of one or more input ports,
e.g., equi-distant logging when using a time ticker as input, or event based logging when listening
on the state change of a button from a device.
