 * so you can visualize them using graphviz / dotty to inspect your creation.
 * Graphs can be read from files and from strings in memory.

  /**
   * Loads a graph from file.
   * @param strGraphXmlFile an absolute or relative path to the graph xml file
                      to load.
* @param strGraphTag this tag is passed to the nodes as "tag" value, it can be used
              to create quick hacks, for example set a node in/out-value to the
              tag as given here. Mainly used by ViSTA in cluster mode currently.
              The node creation method is passed a VistaPropertyList with params, one
              of them being strGraphTag the value of "tag"
              If you are unsure what to pass here, pass the empty string.
* @param bEvaluateGraph a graph needs an initial VdfnGraph::Evaluate(0) call in order
              to function properly. Pass true here, if you want to have that call
              done at the end of loading. Sometimes, a few parts might be adjusted
              after loading and before a first call to Evaluate(), if you have a
              case like this: pass false here but do not forget to call the
              VdfnGraph::Evaluate(0) after you did what needed to be done.
* @param bStrict the strict flag can be set to true in order to cause NULL to be returned
              on encounter of an error. false can lead to return incomplete graphs.
* @return NULL iff the file was not found or somehow corrupt a pointer to a VdfnGraph
                              else. However, the graph may not be as expected, then it is a
'partial' graph. For example, if the content of the file are not set correctly (for example wrong
edges). In the latter case there currently is only an output to stderr with the tinyXML error
message.
