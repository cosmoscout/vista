a little tool to convert the raw output of the driver to a wav file format.
uses libsndfile in a recent version.
needs two files:

* format file (ASCII), with two strings in the first line
  [format] [samplerate]
  where format is [MONO8|MONO16|STEREO8|STEREO16] and samplerate is a non-null/non-negative samples per second integer
  
* raw file containing just the samples and nothing else
