VistaCHAI3DHapticDevicesDriver
-------------


GENERAL INFO

This is a abstract driver which uses the CHAI3D framework to connect
various haptic devices with the ViSTA software library for virtual
reality applications. 


DEPENDENCIES

You need version 2.0.0 of CHAI3D to build this driver module. You
can grab it on the author's site (http://www.chai3d.org/). Other versions of the
library are not tested yet and may or may not work as well. 


LICENSING

This plugin employs the CHAI3D library (http://www.chai3d.org/) to
interface with different hardware via Firewire or Parallelport,
against which it links dynamically.

USAGE

As already mentionend you need the CHAI3D library version 2.0.0. Additionally you have to add 
"%CHAI3D_ROOT%\lib\msvc9" and "%CHAI3D_ROOT%\bin" to your additional-link-directories and path-environment-variable.
If you use the driver in combination with a Phantom device, you additionally have to add %OPENHAPTICS_ROOT%\lib to your path-environment-variable.
The driver is only tested under windows 32 bit and with the following devices: 
- Virtual Device (Should start automatically if no other device is connected)
- PHANTOM omni
- PHANTOM Premium 1.5 6DOF
- Novint Falcon
