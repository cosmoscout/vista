PHANToMDriver
-------------


GENERAL INFO

This is a device driver for use of Sensable's family of PHANToM input
devices with the ViSTA software library for virtual reality
applications. 


DEPENDENCIES

You need version 3.0 of OpenHaptics to build this driver module. You
can grab it on the author's site (http://www.sensable.com) or from the
resources subdirectory of this driver module. Other versions of the
library are not tested yet and may or may not work as well.


LICENSING

This plugin employs the OpenHaptics library (http://www.sensable.com) to
interface with the hardware via Firewire or Parallelport,
against which it links dynamically.


USAGE

To use input devices under Linux, the OpenHaptics libs must be installed
and also the PHANToM driver. Make sure that the kernel module raw1394 is
loaded and /dev/raw1394 has write permissions to all users who want to
use the PHANToM device. This can be done by this udev rule e.g.:
KERNEL=="raw1394", MODE="0666"
