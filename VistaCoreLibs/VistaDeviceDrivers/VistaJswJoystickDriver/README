JswJoystickDriver
-----------------

You need version 1.5.7 of the libjsw. A copy can be found in the resources
subdirectory.

This is a joystick driver using the Linux/Bsd Joystick wrapper library
jsw.  See http://www.battlefieldlinux.com/wolfpack/libjsw.  This URL
seems to be down as of May 2010. The 1.5.8 source can however still be
downloaded from freshmeat at http://freshmeat.net/projects/libjsw/.
Since there were no changes to the project since 2004, we might
consider switching to another joystick wrapper library (see
e.g. http://plib.sourceforge.net/js/index.html).

The jsw library is covered by the GPL

The code was developed on the basis of the linux kernel support for joysticks
and the jsw library version 1.5.7, tested on Ubuntu 8.04.

NOTES
-----

* the jscalibrator utility of libjsw needs gtk-1.2 to run, it will not compile
  when using gtk-2.0 and above. As newer distros of ubuntu (for example) do not
  ship the old version anymore and gtk-1.2 can not really be built on 64bit
  machines (am I wrong here?) the calibration process for this library is as
  good as dead.
* the libjsw can be compiled on modern linux distros, however, you might switch:
  
  CC=gcc
  CPP=g++
  
  and add the option -fPIC to the CFLAGS in the makefiles distributed.
  
* the libjsw default location of the joystick is /dev/js0, however, modern
  linux distros use /dev/input/js0. Either create a symlink or pass the
  device name to the Vista driver using the protocol aspect.
