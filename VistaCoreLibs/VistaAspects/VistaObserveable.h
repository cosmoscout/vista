/**
 * This is an interface class for a basic implementation of a simple observer-pattern
 * as presented by Gamma et.al.
 * This class defines the interface for observables, meaning entities that can change
 * their state and inform multiple observers about this state change.
 * Observers are kept in a list which is managed by this class. Note that observers may
 * outlive their observables in this implementation, so there has to be a deletion scheme that
 * assures that there are no dangling pointers in different observers.
 * For that reason, this class implements a deletion scheme that informs all attached
 * observers about the deletion. Note that the clearing of stored pointers is part of the
 * observer implementation.
 * One thing to notice about event notifications and change sets:
 * - you can turn off notifications when doing a series of updates (called 'set-run')
         using SetNotificationFlag())
 * - during the set-run, when observers are attached, a set of messages
         is collected. You can retrieve the set using the GetChangedSetConstRef() API
 * - after the run, you can turn on notification then (SetNotificationFlag())
 * - you can send the update messages by iterating over the change set, but do not
         forget to call ClearChangeSet() afterwards, otherwise some messages might
         be sent twice.
 *
 * Another thing about the handling of DeleteMessages:
 * - a call to the destructor of an observable will call IVistaObserver::ObserveableDelete()
         note that at the time of call, all specialized members are already DELETED by the
 specialized destructors (destructors are called from the most specific node to the root), so it is
 not wise to work on any member of an IVistaObserveable inside the method
         IVistaObserver::ObserveableDelete() unless you know what you are doing!
         This especially means not to downcast the observable pointer to anything else than
         an IVistaObserveable itself!
 * - it surely is a wise thing to provide a de-registration for  observables besides the call
         to "delete" with the instance pointer, you can use the MSG_PREDELETE then to indicate
         what you intend to do for waiting views/observers.
