/**
 * This class serves as a simple base class for home-grown serialization methods.
 * Serializing means something like "preserving an object's state into a kind of
 * serial representation e.g. stream or similiar". The basic idea behind it is
 * that an object usually is composed of base-types (int, doubles etc.) or
 * other objects that are composed of basetypes at some level and so on. So usually
 * what you want to do is to send an object in a stream to a different machine
 * and assemble another instance with the same attribute values on this machine.
 * In our teminology all objects that are to be serialized have to be  of the base
 * type "IVistaSerializable" which does define the methods "Serialize" and "DeSerialize"
 * which do what is depicted above. They use the interface of a serializer or
 * deserialzer in order to streamline their basetypes or hand the serializer/desirializer
 * to their complex aggregates. Note that this mechanism sounds simple, but has its
 * very own advantages and disadvantages.<br>
 * This interface supports the idea of writing variables that are assigned to names
 * in order to enable a non-linear retrieval on the peer sides of this serializer.
 * So all methods are available either in the form of simple methods or with the
 * prefix "Name" to the method name (e.g. WriteInt32() and WriteInt32Name()). The first
 * one forces that any peer has to know the correct order of the incoming data, while
 * the other one allows that incoming data is stored in tables and retrieved later
 * on. Note that this is currently only the sketch of an idea and might not be appropriate
 * at all.
