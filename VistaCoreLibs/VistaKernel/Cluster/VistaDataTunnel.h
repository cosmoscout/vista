/**
 * IVistaDataTunnel defines the generic base behavior for a 'tunnel-like' data channel. The tunnel
 *basically consists of two one directional tubes, which in turn are implemented as
 *DataLaViSTA-pipelines. The <b>IDEA</b> behind the data tunnel is this: Suppose you want to
 *transmit data between different endpoints (say a VR-system and a remote computer generating data).
 *Now assume your VR-system is a cluster architecture and the incoming data needs to be received at
 *all nodes. The task of IVistaDataTunnel is to solve just this problem transparently, without
 *having you to bother about the actual implementation details. In particular the VistaDataTunnel is
 *meant to even hide these details from its user completely, i.e. an application using the tunnel
 *doesn't need to know whether it's running in a cluster or not. All you need to know is that you
 *push "something" inside on the one end and you will eventually get "something" in return. By
 *"something" we mean anything which is wrapped into an IDLVistaDataPacket-derivative of your
 *choice.
 *
 * For all this to work we need some ASSUMPTION and DEFINITIONS:
 * -	IVistaDataTunnel internally provides two separate, one-directional channels (like the two
 *tubes of a tunnel). One is called UPSTREAM, the other one DOWNSTREAM. -	The UPSTREAM is used
 *to post any kind of REQUEST packets. These packets are passed through the pipe and eventually they
 *will be translated into a request of any application-specific kind. NOTE that these packets can
 *contain anything, from simple parameter data to ... -	The DOWNSTREAM is used to handle the answer
 *to a previously postet request. It transports the data to where it can be processed meaningfully.
 * - In a STANDALONE environment the setup is just two tubes, forwarding the packets given to them.
 * - In a cluster environment there are two special roles
 *	>	The MASTER is allowed to post requests normally. These will be processed by the
 *master's upstream consumer. The feedback will be handled by the master's downstream producer which
 *sends them downstream. On their way downstream, the packets will be mirrored to the clients.
 *	>	All SLAVE request will be lost deliberately.
 *		the very same request due to the "mirrored application concept"
 *	>	The MASTER mirrors any downstream packets to the clients which in turn can then issue
 *them to their very own downstream pipe. Thus for the client it looks like the answer to his
 *request just came directly to him >	Any downstream packets produced by the SLAVE's downstream
 *producer will never see the light of day again, since they will end up in a dead end. The
 *downstream packets which are consumed by the client's downstream consumer come from the data
 *collector which in turn receives them from the master.
 *	>>>	As you can deduce from the above statements, it is generally a good idea to use the
 *downstream pipe in PULL MODE ONLY, since otherwise you will eventually run into trouble...
 *
 * -	In order for data to be processable by the pipeline, it must be stowed in a
 *IDLVistaDataPacket (...or concrete subclass). Note that the data tunnel doesn't know a thing about
 *the content of the packet. It just operates on the given interface.
 * - The data tunnel's upstream is always realized as a passive component, i.e. you have to provide
 *control flow to it. In constrast the downstream is active for Client and Master implementation),
 *meaning that there is a thread in each one, actively pushing data through the tunnel. You won't
 *notice this though since the tunnel's downstream output is connected to a queue in which all
 *packets are stowed until YOU retrieve them. NOTE: When you don't want your application to know
 *about its role in the cluster, it might be a good idea to settle with a passive UpstreamOutput as
 *well as passive DownstreamInput pipe, since these elements will not have any function on a cluster
 *client. Thus the threads used for their implementation if they were active would just eat up cpu
 *time doing nothing in effect.
 *
 * Please remember, that your application will not notice any of the internal handling. It just
 *connects to the up/downstream of the data tunnel. Thus, the 'tunnel metaphor' holds, i.e. you
 *won't have a clue
 * (...and don't need to have), to what happens 'in there'.
 *
 * USAGE:
 * In order to use the DataTunnel you'll have to implement the following classes:
 * - An UpstreamProducer. This is the one that fills request packets and sends them down the
 *upstream pipe. -	An UpstreamConsumer. This one handles incoming packets, unwraps them and
 *translates them to any request/call which might be needed.
 * - A DownstreamProducer. It handles the incoming data. You just need to wrap your data in some
 *implementation of IDLVistaDataPacket.
 * - A DownstreamConsumer, which will provide the data to your application. The consumer typically
 *unwraps the data and NOTE: There is no direct access to the 'tunnel tubes'. You'll have to handle
 *this via DLV-components. This might seem to be an inhibition but a DLV-pipe is a closed system
 *itself and thus there is no 'easy' or 'nice' way to pass data to the user.
 *
 * ADD. NOTES:
 *	- There is exactly one input and one output of the upstream and downstream respectively...
 *	- ...
